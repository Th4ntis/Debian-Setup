# My-BS My-BuntuScript
This is a script to setup a fresh install of buntu. This will setup some keyboard shortcuts I use, power settings, etc.
Script is very self explanitory. It installs a list of software via APT, then will add APT apt repositories for Timeshift, Cryptomator, and Yubico, get keyrings for Element and Signal, then install said software. Will also get the .deb file for Discord and veracypt and install those.
Will install fusuma for touchpad gestures for laptops.
Will install zsh and Oh-My-ZSH and pull my Dotfiles and config files for Vim, ZSH, and Tmux, get plugins and reboot to apply changes. Only thing this doesnt do it themeing since that depends on my mood. ;P
