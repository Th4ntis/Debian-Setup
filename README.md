# My-BuntuScript
Disclaimer: **I did NOT create or develop any of these tools**

This is still a work in a progress as I am adding additional tools and updating the script as I got. Any constructive criticism welcome or any other tool suggestions are welcome as well.

This is a script to setup a fresh install of buntu. This will setup some keyboard shortcuts I use, power settings, etc.

Script is very self explanitory. It removes snap, adds the firefox PPA and reinstalls firefox, installs a list of software via APT, then will add APT apt repositories for [Cryptomator](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Cryptomator&t=brave&ia=web), [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net/), and [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubico-authenticator/), [OBS](https://obsproject.com/). Will also get the necessary files for [Discord](https://discord.com/), [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/), Google Chrome, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), 

Will install [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma) for touchpad gestures for laptops.
Will install zsh and [Oh-My-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) and pull my [Dotfiles](https://github.com/Th4ntis/dotfiles) for Vim, ZSH, Terminator, and Tmux, get plugins and reboot to apply changes. Only thing this doesnt do it themeing since that depends on my mood. ;P
