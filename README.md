# My-BS My-BuntuScript
This is a script to setup a fresh install of buntu. This will setup some keyboard shortcuts I use, power settings, etc.
Script is very self explanitory. It installs a list of software via APT, then will add APT apt repositories for [Timeshift](https://github.com/teejee2008/timeshift), [Cryptomator](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Cryptomator&t=brave&ia=web), and [Yubico](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubico-authenticator/), get keyrings for [Element](https://element.io/) and [Signal](https://www.signal.org/), then install said software. Will also get the .deb file for [Discord]()https://discord.com/ and [Veracypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/code/VeraCrypt/) and install those.
Will install [fusuma](https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma) for touchpad gestures for laptops.
Will install zsh and [Oh-My-ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) and pull my [Dotfiles](https://github.com/Th4ntis/dotfiles) for Vim, ZSH, and Tmux, get plugins and reboot to apply changes. Only thing this doesnt do it themeing since that depends on my mood. ;P
